## Introduction

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. This tool allows you to input a string and determine whether it is a palindrome or not.

## Features

- Check whether a string is a palindrome or not.
- Support for both single words and phrases.
- Case-insensitive comparison (e.g., "Racecar" is considered a palindrome).
- Ignore non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., punctuation, spaces).

## Usage

To use the palindrome checker, simply input a string and click the "Check" button. The tool will then display whether the input string is a palindrome or not.

### Example

Input: "racecar"
Output: "Yes, it's a palindrome!"

Input: "Hello, world!"
Output: "No, it's not a palindrome."
